## **Introduction to Recursion in Python**


### **What you learn in this segment of the tutorial**
- Understand what is recursion
- Implement non-recursion for factorial problem
- Implement recursion for factorial problem
- Understand the potential issues using recursion

### **Introduction**
Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself. A recursive function is a function that calls itself.

### **Factorial Problem**
Given an integer, factorial of the integer is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.

For example, factorial of 4 (or 4!) is `1*2*3*4 = 24`

### **Coding steps**

- Non-Recursive approach using while loop

- Recursive approach


### **When to use**
- Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems.
- Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
- Good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach.

### **When not to use**
- Readability. The logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
- Resource Usage. Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
